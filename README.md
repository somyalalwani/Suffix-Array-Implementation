## Q1: Implementation of suffix array


### A. Given a string S print its minimum lexicographic rotation. O(nlogn)

### B. Given an integer K, print the length of the longest substring that appears in the text at least K times.If no such substring exist, print -1. O(nlogn)

### C. Given a strings S determine its longest substring that is also a palindrome. In the case of multiple solutions, print the lexicographically smallest palindrome. O(nlogn)
